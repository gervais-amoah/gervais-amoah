### Hello world <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Gervais, and I'm a mid frontend developer. I'm on a journey to become a fullstack senior developer by learning new things, working on challenging projects, and perfecting my coding skills. I'm interested in AI, Web 3, and IoT. 

I love reading and watching philosophical and scientific documentaries. I enjoy anything that will make me more productive and a better person.
